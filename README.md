📊 Excel Data Analysis Project — Data Technician Bootcamp

This project was completed as part of my Data Technician Bootcamp, analyzing two datasets: The Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes and a Sales Dataset. The focus was on applying key Excel techniques to categorize, summarize, and visualize data effectively.

🔍 Dataset Summary

🌪️ Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes Dataset
Includes detailed information about major hurricanes: Hurricane Name, Start Date, Category (1–5), Estimated Damage (USD)

🛒 Sales Dataset
